                “The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.” This could describe the Jungian approach in therapy, in life and at work, whose common denominator is flexibility, creativity and originality. This is also reflected on how I address the problems and needs of each client. In my work I apply my professional knowledge and experience obtained working as a psychologist for children and adults in different non-governmental organizations and counseling centers in Slovakia and other countries. In 2012 I started my own counseling center concept that has worked in different cities with the name of Bienestar Counseling Center.
