<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We offer counseling in the entire spectrum of emotional, personal and psychosomatic problems (physical illnesses from headaches, stomach aches, allergies, dermal problems, etc that appear after a serious, stressful or difficult situation), divorce and post-divorce states, chronic diseases and pain, and more.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We advise you how to resolve problems related to the difficulties of defiant children and how to handle the situation when you get angry.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We review the maturity of your child and his readiness for school. If your child is not ready, we offer a 9 month INPP school program of exercises that help mature the central nervous system and ready your preschooler for school, all in a playful and fun way.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Is your child hyperactive, does he have problems with attention, learning or behavior? We will gladly advise you on this.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you need more information about child development, personal grow, and healthy lifestyles for your child or teenager, do not hesitate to ask us.
